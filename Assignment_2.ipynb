A naive method for determining whether two documents are similar is to treat them as collections of words (bag of words) and use the number of words they share as a proxy for their similarity. It makes sense that two books with religion as the topic (e.g.  `398.txt` and `3296.txt`) would have more words in common than a book that discusses religion and a book that discusses science fiction (e.g. books `84.txt` and `398.txt`). \n",

Rather the ratio of comparisons over the number of words from both books may be a better evaluation metric instead since it accounts for the length of both books possibly being a factor. With that being said it still isn't very accurate either, as discussed in class today(Nov 1.) collecting and seperating the generalized words from the list of shared words to aquire the unique shared words may be a better evaluation process to determine topic similarity."

    "As discussed in question 15 and 17, simple comaprisons based on word quantities have been less than successful and a focus on unique words may be an initial solution to the issue of topic similarity. I would also argue that using a ratio rather than a count may also assist. For example, when comparing three or more books to determine if two may share a topic, all the shared words between the books can be grouped to form a general list of distinct words. This list can then be used to determine the unique words any two books share in order to form a ratio to base a comparison on to ensure comparisons between books with more words aren't unequally compared."
